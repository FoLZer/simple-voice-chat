This mod adds a proximity voice chat to your Minecraft server.
You can choose between push to talk (PTT) or voice activation.

## Important Notes

You need to open a port on the server.
This is port `24454/udp` by default.
Without opening this port, the voice chat will not work.
This port can be changed in the server config.
More information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki?t=setup).

You need to have this mod installed on the server and the client for it to work.

The voice chat is encrypted, but I don't guarantee the security of it.
Use at your own risk!
